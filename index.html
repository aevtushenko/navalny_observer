Two floors of food is always appealing, no less here than anywhere else, but what I love especially about this establishment is its sunken lower floor and proximity to one of SG&rsquo;s coolest old-school buildings. You&rsquo;ll notice immediately that you need to take a half-flight of stairs down to get to the first floor of deliciousness, which makes it feel like you&rsquo;re eating your tulang from the famous <b>Haji Kadir Sup Tulang #B1-15</b> in a cave, which is fitting. And then, behold! Golden Mile Complex, which is across the street (overhead walkway provided!) from the food centre. What a neat building. It&rsquo;s Singapore&rsquo;s Little Thailand, which is awesome, and Beer Thai (yup, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called) is wonderful, but the building itself is the best part.

I thought that chicken wings might work, so I approached <b>Chong Pang Heng #01-98</b>. They had wings, but they had a whole bird, too. I jumped for the complete package. Ten-minute wait, I think it was. They brought &lsquo;em down close to the charcoal, got that toast game up, then onto the chopping block, into chunky hunks, and into a brown bag inside a plastic bag. So I&rsquo;m walking back towards my house with this bag of chicken, let&rsquo;s say around 9pm on this here March 3rd, and with my first bite of poultry I&rsquo;m convulsed by higher order powers. I scarcely exaggerate when I say that this was the chickeniest chicken I. Had. Ever. Tasted. I was beside myself.

Nowhere is the physical joining of wet market and food centre more artful than at Jurong West 505.
